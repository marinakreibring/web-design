            <h2>Hello! My name is Marina Kreibring.</h2>
            <p>I'm a beginning web-developer from Belarus. Since 2024 I live in Germany. I love to explore new web-design features and apply them to my projects.</p>
            <p>Currently, I study at Brigham Young University-Idaho remotely. Before that, I graduated from Minsk State Linguistic University with a Bachelor of TEFL; and earlier from Borisov Pedagogical College with honors. I speak Russian and Belarusian (native), English (C1-C2), and German (B1 and learning further).</p> 
            <p>I worked at school as an English teacher for 10 years. I taught English to students from grades 1 through 8, designing and delivering engaging lessons that fostered language development and critical thinking. I implemented innovative teaching methodologies and incorporated out-of-school activities to enhance learning outcomes and create a dynamic, student-centered classroom environment.</p>
            <p>After that, I worked for 10 years at a humanitarian NGO as a project coordinator. I organized and supervised volunteer services and multiple humanitarian projects, including 12 major international initiatives such as Neonatal Resuscitation Training and Autism Conferences in Belarus. I coordinated teams, managed logistics, and ensured successful execution of programs aimed at improving community health and education outcomes. My work experience allowed me to develop leadership and organizational skills in addition to my knowledge of languages.</p>
            <p>In July 2022, I earned a Computer Support Certificate from BYU-Idaho, gaining expertise in maintaining and troubleshooting computer hardware, resolving software, network, and security issues, and configuring network routers, switches, and servers.</p>
            <p>After completing a Web and Computer Programming Certificate in July 2023, I developed a strong passion for designing and developing websites. I am proficient in creating web pages and applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON, as well as developing computer programs in Java and Python.</p>
            <p>In August 2025, I earned a System Administration Certificate and an Associate Degree in Applied Technology from BYU-Idaho. I am currently pursuing a Web Development Certificate and plan to complete my Bachelor's degree in the near future.</p>
            <p>During my years of study and work, I have developed strong skills in troubleshooting, teamwork and collaboration, time management, interpersonal communication, problem-solving, and adaptability. I am an open, reliable, responsible, and team-oriented professional who thrives in dynamic environments.</p>
